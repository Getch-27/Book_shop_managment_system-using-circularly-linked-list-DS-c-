# Book shop managment sysytem using circuraly linkedlist  data structure cpp
This is a C++ program for a book shop management system that uses a circularly linked list data structure primarily to give the owner control over the store's information.
# Features
* Add new book : After entering the book's information, the data will be stored in a single node of a linked list, with the order being determined by the title using the add node methods at the beginning, middle, and end of the list. finally saves to file.
* Show available book:retrive the linked list

* Show most and least sold books:using merge sort algorithm display in ascending order. display it in descending order the program uses stuck ,
* Charity and discount
* Delete
* Show store status
* Save information to file
# Applied Data structures and algorithms
* Circular single linked list
* Linked list implemented stuck, The linked list is stored in the stuck and is used to help print the data using LIFO in descending order.
* Merge sort algorithm
* Linear search algorithm
